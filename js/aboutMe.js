        <p class="block has-text-primary-dark"> As a Web Developer, I enjoy the challenge for creative solutions, and the demand for curiosity, critical thinking, and efficient code required to produce content worthy of an audience. I am passionate about building as well as deconstructing 'things' while learning throughout the whole process. <br><br>
        
        I am also familiar with many aspects of Back-End Development, UX/UI, and Content Management Systems. I am currently utilizing these skills with the ultimate goal of joining a team that enjoys solving difficult problems, shares in my appreciation for direct, clear, and concise communication and open-minded feedback.</p>

          As introduced by The 4 Agreements, I subscribe to the idea that all humans are artists and life is our canvas. Seeing the world through this filter, I am excited and intrigued by others' creations. I respect their style and encourage their best because life has shown me that when people feel safe, happy, and motivated, awesome things are created!
